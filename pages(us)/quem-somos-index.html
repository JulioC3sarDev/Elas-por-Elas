        We are in the second semester of the Systems Analysis and Development course — Júlio, Nathaly, 
        Eduarda, Gabriel, and Lucas — united with a greater goal: to use technology to change lives.
        Elas por Elas is an academic project, yet it emerged with the intensity of an urgent and concrete cause.
        We believe that technology can (and should) act as an ally in combating the violence that women
        face daily. For this reason, we created an application/website that provides a safe,
        accessible, and receptive environment for women to make reports and seek help safely and independently.
        We are aware that we are not capable of changing the world alone. However, with empathy, commitment, and 
        collaboration, we aim to help build a more just society, where all voices are considered.
